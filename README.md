Daily Work Load - Written almost entirely by ChatGPT


This project was started with the use of ChatGPT.

It designed and created most of these files.

I've only assembled the pieces. Enjoy!

There are a few bugs in this code. 


Warning ----------

Sandbox is turned OFF

This will create a folder in your Documents folder called:

DailyWorkLoad


Any files there will be clobbered.


Also you have to grant privilages to the app once compiled to allow the app to control your computer.

Control Panel => Privacy & Security => Accessability has to be enabled for the App.

This a functional app now.

Everything works as expected. 

Enjoy!
